give you time to cancel payment of the next Fee if you are not happy with the change.</p>
<p>4.2 The Fee for the Novecore™ Premium Plan is calculated to reflect the number of Artists you have included within

<p>6.1 If you have a valid current Plan, you may upload Releases to the Site in the format that we reasonably require.
We may reject or remove any Release at any time without liabilty and at our sole discretion. If we do so and your
Release is the only Release you have uploaded for a particular Artist within your Novecore™ Premium Plan, then we
shall adjust the Fee accordingly.</p>
<p>6.2 You hereby grant to us a worldwide, exclusive right and licence to:</p>
<ol>
<li>copy, reproduce, transmit, publish and distribute the Releases to Music Platforms and within the Monetization
Service for commercial exploitation; and</li>
<li>collect all income derived from the exploitation described in Condition 6.2(a)</li>
</ol>
<p>6.3 You hereby grant to us a worldwide non-exclusive right and licence to:</p>
<ol>
<li>use insubstantial parts of the Releases in marketing materials for the Releases, the Site and our business
generally; and&lt;</li>
<li>use your name and likeness (and if different, the Artist’s name and likeness) and any other information you
provide to us about you or the Artist, in relation to the Releases.</li>
</ol>
<p>6.4 We can at our sole discretion sub-license the rights granted to us under Conditions 6.2 and 6.3 to any third
party, including our group companies.</p>
<p>6.5 You warrant and represent that:</p>
<ol>
<li>you are the owner of the copyrights in the Releases, or you have the written agreement from the owners of the
copyrights in the Releases to allow you to upload the Release to the Site and grant the licence under Conditions 6.2
and 6.3 above. This includes for the avoidance of doubt, any samples included in a Release</li>
<li>you have the written agreement of the Artist to upload each Artist’s Release to the Site, and grant the licence
under Conditions 6.2 and 6.3 above</li>
<li>we may exercise the licence under Conditions 6.2 and 6.3 above without the permission or and/or payment of any
sums to any third party, including any producer, writer or Artist</li>

otherwise an attempt to impersonate any third party; and does not include any brand name of any third party.</li>
</ol>
<p>6.6 You further warrant and represent that the Releases do not include any content that:</p>

registered an account under a false name, then, without notice or further liability to you we may:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove any Artist and/or Release from your Plan</li>
<li>cancel your Plan and access to the Site and/or your account; and/or</li>
<li>withhold any Royalties due to you</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="7-royalties">7. Royalties</h2>
<p>7.1 The calculation of your Royalties is set out in the description of your Plan. For the Monetization Service, an
additional 15% revenue share is charged before your plan’s revenue share.</p>
<p>7.2 Royalties are due only in respect of sums received from Music Platforms, Aggregators and through the
Monetization Service. Music Platforms have the right to determine the fee due to download your Release and the
providers of the Monetization Service determine how to monetize your Releases. Music Platforms, Aggregators and/or
the providers of the Monetization Service may not pay any sums to us, and/or may require repayment of sums paid to
us if they reasonably suspect fraudulent activity in respect of your Releases or your account generally, such as
artificial streaming activity.</p>

the Royalties earned, and we shall pay these to the bank account you have provided to us. You are responsible for
any bank fees due on such withdrawal. You cannot withdraw more funds than are available in your account and the
minimum withdrawal is US$20 or the equivalent in any other currency.</p>
<p>7.4 If cumulative withdrawals from your account reach £500, or such other sum as we may elect, or at any other time
we determine, you must upload and submit identification documents as part of our regulatory requirements. Until
these documents have been provided, the funds will be held in your account.</p>

services or any financial services to you.</p>
<p>7.6 You may not offset Royalties against Fees due to us.</p>
<h2 id="8-disclaimer">8. Disclaimer</h2>
<p>8.1 We cannot control the activities of Music Platforms and the providers of the Monetization Service. We therefore
do not warrant or represent that any Music Platforms and/or the providers of the Monetization Service will accept
your Release to their platform, or pay any sums to us. Accordingly, we do not warrant or represent that you will
receive any Royalties, or any minimum level of Royalties.</p>
<p>8.2 Subject to Condition 8.4, we shall in no circumstances be liable to you in contract, tort (including negligence)

</ol>
<p>The provisions of this Condition 8.2 are severable.</p>
<p>8.3 Subject to Condition 8.4, our maximum liability to you whether in contract, tort or otherwise shall in no
circumstances exceed the Royalties paid to you in the previous 6 months.</p>
<p>8.4 Nothing in the Terms shall be construed as excluding or limiting our liability for death or personal injury
caused by our negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for any other liability that cannot be
excluded by English law.</p>
<p>8.5 Our Site may include third party advertisements, which may be targeted towards you. We do not endorse or
recommend any product or service offered for sale by any advertiser within the advertisements on the Site and we are
not responsible for the content of any third party advertisement.</p>

claims, losses, damages, expenses and liabilities that we may suffer or incur arising as a result of any claim
received by us in relation to:</p>
<p>9.1 our use and exploitation of your Releases, including any third party claim for copyright or other IP Right
infringement</p>
<p>9.2 any failure to comply with any third party licence requirement relating to your Releases; and</p>
<p>9.3 your acts or omissions, including your breach of these Terms, negligence and/or reckless default</p>

</ol>
<p>11.2 If we terminate your Plan, then all Releases are removed. However, subject to Condition 6.7, you may still
access your account to view Royalties due to you.</p>
<p>11.3 Following termination by us of your right to use the Site, you must cease to use the Site and you must not
re-register on the Site under any other name.</p>

</ol>

agreement relating to your use of the Site and in relation to your Plan.</p>

such provision shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and all other
